## <span class="myheader">Loading HEVD driver</span>

In this post we will be exploiting the Stack Overflow vulnerability in the [HEVD](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) driver. Before that, I recommend to read the previous blogpost where I explain some basic concepts.

To load the driver, download first the pre-built executable from [here](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/releases) (or build it from source if you have too much time). Then, download and run the [OSR Driver Loader](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm%5earticle=157.htm) to load the driver in the debugee:

If all went well, you should see a new driver in the list of loaded modules:

## <span class="myheader">Vulnerability</span>

Vulnerability exists in the [BufferOverflowStack.c](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/blob/master/Driver/HEVD/Windows/BufferOverflowStack.c) file:

```c++
#ifdef SECURE
        //
        // Secure Note: This is secure because the developer is passing a size
        // equal to size of KernelBuffer to RtlCopyMemory()/memcpy(). Hence,
        // there will be no overflow
        //

        RtlCopyMemory((PVOID)KernelBuffer, UserBuffer, sizeof(KernelBuffer));
#else
        DbgPrint("[+] Triggering Buffer Overflow in Stack\n");

        //
        // Vulnerability Note: This is a vanilla Stack based Overflow vulnerability
        // because the developer is passing the user supplied size directly to
        // RtlCopyMemory()/memcpy() without validating if the size is greater or
        // equal to the size of KernelBuffer
        //

        RtlCopyMemory((PVOID)KernelBuffer, UserBuffer, Size);
```

Inspecting <code>else</code> condition, we notice that the <code>RtlCopyMemory</code> function copies full length of the supplied UserBuffer to the KernelBuffer leading to the stack buffer overflow vulnerability, as we are able to overwrite information on the stack and diverge the code execution from a current path to e.g. a shellcode.
In the <code>SECURE</code> version, this is taken care of as max len of copied data is not larger than KernelBuffer itself.
