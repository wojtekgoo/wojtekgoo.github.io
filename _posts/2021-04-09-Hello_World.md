## Welcome to my realm
I decided to create this blog when I was preparing for the [Advanced Windows Exploitation](https://www.offensive-security.com/awe-osee/) course (which ultimately did not happen in 2020 nor 2021 because of COVID). As I delved more into Windows Kernel programming and other low-level stuff, I felt I have to organize my thoughts in some structured manner so if there are any gaps in the topics I'm researching, I will have to learn about it. I hope blogging will force me to teach myself what I don't know and to articulate what I do know.

I want to use this blog as a way to keep organized notes and deep-dive into concepts I want to learn so I can reference them in future. Majority of what I create here will not be anything new or my own thoughts/ideas.
