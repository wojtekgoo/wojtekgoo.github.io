> **Note**: Work In Progress

Having spent few years in cybersecurity, I decided I want to do some research on the Windows exploitation which has always fascinated me, but I never felt ready yet to do it seriously.  
Finally, as I am fond of Offensive Security trainings, I booked a ticket for the [Advanced Windows Exploitation](https://www.offensive-security.com/awe-osee/) course to learn developing modern exploits and bypassing Microsoft's defenses. Although it did not happen due to the COVID-19 outbreak, I began extensive research in kernel exploitation. At some point I felt I have to organize my thoughts in more structured manner, so here I am blogging my progress as a way for me to reinforce concepts and keep notes I can reference later on. I hope blogging will force me to teach myself what I do not know and to articulate what I do know.
